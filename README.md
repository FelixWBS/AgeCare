# AgeCare — Care that listens
A voice-first, agentic AI health assistant for older adults.

## Overview
AgeCare is an accessible iOS app that helps older adults manage health tasks through natural voice interaction.  
The app uses agentic AI to interpret spoken input and convert it into structured appointments and reminders.  
Goal: increase independence, reduce caregiver workload, and support the healthcare system.

## Features
- Voice → agentic AI → structured appointment  
- Automatic, context-aware reminders  
- Voice notes converted into clean, structured health information  
- Senior-friendly UI with large, simple navigation  
- Local, privacy-first storage using SwiftData

## Agentic AI
AgeCare goes beyond transcription:
- detects user intent  
- resolves dates and time expressions  
- classifies medical context  
- structures the extracted data for scheduling and tracking

## Impact
- Greater independence for older adults  
- Fewer missed appointments and medication gaps  
- Reduced workload for families and caregivers  
- Relief for the healthcare system through clearer communication and better-prepared visits

## Future Potential
- Integration with national digital health records (EHR / ePA)  
- AI-based medical summaries and simplified explanations  
- Medication management and adherence support  
- Early detection of health risks via behavioral patterns  
- Automated bureaucratic workflows (forms, documents, instructions)

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI  
- SwiftData  
- Speech Recognition  
- Agentic AI (LLM-based)  
- Lightweight MVVM architecture
